Here are some dates to think about before you purchase.

- __Order Date__ - Date you purchased.
- __Delivery Date__ - This is the date that the sample must arrive at the host.
- __Run Date__ - This is the date when you sample will start its run on the instrument.
- __Date Delivery Date__ - This is the date you sample data will be available for download.

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px;">Cancelation Policy</h4>
In the first 48 hours after a purchase a sample order can be cancelled, with
a full refund. After the 48 hour period, a sample will be charged.

<h4 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 26px;">Penalties</h4>
Yes, Meenta has penalties.

- __Late Samples__ - If a sample arrives late, after the 'Delivery Date', the
user will be charged a 10% fee. Why a fee? The host will need to reschedule your sample
in their LIM system.

- __Date Delivery__ - If the host does not delivery sample date by the 'Date Delivery' date, then meenta assesses the host a 10% fee.
