	<h4 id="meenta-host-terms-of-use">Meenta Host Terms of Use</h4>

	<p>
		Welcome to <a href="https://meenta.io">https://meenta.io</a> (the "Site"), an online platform connecting academic laboratories and other research institutions approved by Meenta, such as yourself ("Hosts") with users ("Meenta Users") who possess biological samples or specimens ("Specimens").  Through the Site, Hosts offer Meenta Users next generation sequencing and related genomics services ("Genomics Services") using sequencing instruments and other similar equipment ("Sequencing Equipment"), and deliver to Users (who elect to purchase such Genomics Services through the Site) the information, data, documentation, reports, results and other products of the Genomics Services (the "Results").
	</p>

	<p>
		You, the Meenta Host who is agreeing to register as a member of this Site (a "Host"), hereby agree to be bound by these Meenta Host Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").  You, the individual person who is registering the Host with this Site (the "Registering User"), by clicking on a check box indicating your and the Host’s agreement to these Terms of Use (or otherwise affirmatively continuing the registering process), represent and warrant that you, the Registering User, have authority to agree to these terms on behalf of the Host you are registering.  By accessing or using the Site, or by registering as a Host with this Site, you, the Host, and each of your authorized users who register as an authorized user of the Host with this Site (each a "Registered User"), signify that you have read and understand these Terms of Use and that you (both the Host and its authorized users) agree to be bound by these Terms of Use.  References in this Agreement to "you" or "your" refer to the Host, except where the text expressly indicates it refers to the Host’s Registering User or Registered Users.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Site is owned and operated by Meenta (sometimes also referred to herein as "we" or "us").  In these Terms of Use, "Host" refers to you (the Meenta Host who has registered with this Site) and references to "Hosts" refers to all Meenta Hosts (including you) who have registered with this Site.
	</p>

	<p>
		You acknowledge and agree that your use of this Site is governed by these Terms of Use.  We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or delete portions of these Terms of Use at any time without further notice.  If we do this, we will post the changes to these Terms of Use on this page and will indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised.  Your continued use of the Site after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use.
	</p>

	<p>If the Meenta Host registering with this Site does not agree to abide by these or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Site.  It is your responsibility to regularly check the Site to determine if there have been changes to these Terms of Use and to review such changes.</p>

	<p><strong> Please read these Terms of Use carefully as they contain important information regarding your legal obligations, remedies, and rights, including various limitations and exclusions. </strong></p>

	<h4 id="eligibility-and-host-registration">Eligibility and Host Registration</h4>
	<p>
		The Site and the Genomics Services are intended solely for persons who are 18 or older.  Any access to or use of the Site by anyone under 18 is expressly prohibited.  By accessing or using the Site, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the initial registration process of the Host, the Registering User of the Host will become the initial "administrator" for the Host’s Meenta account ("Meenta Account").  Your administrator will be able to authorize additional individuals from your organization as your Registered Users of this Site (each with his or her individual login and password).  The administrator may subsequently designate another Registered User as administrator using the functionality of the Site.  Registered Users’ use of this Site, including review and approval of Orders (as defined below) and the provision of Genomics Services, shall be deemed to be the actions of the applicable Host, and Registered Users use this Site subject to these Terms of Use.  Each Registered User is responsible for safeguarding his or her password and agrees not to disclose his or her password to any third party.  Unless expressly authorized by Meenta, you are not permitted to share your Meenta Account with anyone or allow others to access or use your Meenta Account (other than your Registered Users).
	</p>
	<p>
		You agree to provide accurate, current and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current and complete.  You may not have more than one active Meenta Account and we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your Meenta Account and your access to the Site if you create more than one account.</p>

		<h4 id="onboarding-and-updating-your-services-profile">Onboarding and Updating Your Services Profile</h4>

		<p>
			Once you have successfully registered for a Meenta Account, you will be required to complete a setup process (the "Onboarding Process") to be listed on the Site with the other Hosts in Meenta’s network and for Users to be able to see you and request Genomics Services from you.  The Site will guide you through the Onboarding Process, which will require you to describe the types of Genomics Services you will perform by selecting from the choices afforded on the Site.  You will also specify the fees Users will be required to pay for the Genomics Services you are offering.  The Genomics Services you select during the Onboarding Process and the associated fees will be saved to your Meenta Account under your "Services Profile."  You may freely alter, remove or add to the types of Genomics Services you are willing to perform and/or the fees you will charge for such services by updating your Services Profile using the functionality of the Site.
		</p>

		<h4 id="user-requests-for-genomics-services">User Requests for Genomics Services</h4>

		<p>
			From time to time, Users may submit online orders (each, an "Order") requesting that you perform Genomics Services that you have elected to offer on the Site on one or more Specimens provided by the User and deliver to such User all Results.  If the User selects you as its Host to perform Genomics Services that you have elected to offer, the User will select from the choices afforded on the Site and will be required to:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>select from the types of Genomics Services to be performed from among then current services listed in your Services Profile;</li>
			<li>respond to the specific queries asked by the Site in connection with the selected Genomics Services, including delivery and service performance timelines and any Sequencing Equipment necessary to perform such services (the "Service Specifications");</li>
			<li>specify the type and quantity of Specimen(s) the User will provide to you; and</li>
			<li>specify which of the protocols and other guidelines offered on the Site will govern your handling, storage, use and disposal of the Specimens (the "Protocols").</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			The fees the User will pay for the requested Genomics Services will be made available for the User to review before submitting the final Order.  All Internal Users (as defined below) will pay, as compensation to you for performance of the Genomics Services, a services fee equal to the total fees set by you (during the Onboarding Process or by updating your Services Profile) for the requested Genomics Services (the "Genomics Services Fee").  All External Users (as defined below) will pay: (i) as compensation to you for performance of the Genomics Services, the Genomics Services Fee set by you; and (ii) as compensation to Meenta for providing access to the Site and related services, an additional fee equal to ten percent (10%) of the Genomics Services Fee (the "External User Fee").  For purposes of clarity, Internal Users will not be charged an External User Fee.  As used herein, a User is an "Internal User" if you and such User are part of the same laboratory, university or research organization.  An "External User" is any User who is not an Internal User.
		</p>

		<h4 id="meenta-review-and-approval-of-orders">Meenta Review and Approval of Orders</h4>

		<p>
			When a User submits an Order requesting that you perform Genomics Services on such User’s behalf, we will share the terms of the Order with you and you must decide whether to accept or reject the Order.  You must notify us of your decision to accept or reject an Order no later than one (1) business after we notify you of such Order.  Unless we determine otherwise, if you fail to notify us of your decision within the required timeframe, you forfeit your ability to accept the Order and such Order shall be deemed rejected.
		</p>

		<p>
			We may also undertake additional checks and processes designed to help verify that the User will be able to pay the applicable fees, including but not limited to performing a credit check.  You acknowledge and agree that, in addition to your ability to reject an Order, we reserve the right to: (a) reject an Order for any reason in our sole discretion; or (b) condition acceptance of an Order on the User’s down payment of, or the User’s providing a letter of credit covering, all or a portion of the applicable fees, or such other conditions as may be mutually agreed (collectively, "Payment Conditions").
		</p>

		<p>
			Each time you accept an Order submitted by a User (such Order, an "Accepted Order"), you agree to perform the Genomics Services and deliver the Results in accordance with such Accepted Order and these Terms of Use as described below.  Unless we determine otherwise, all Accepted Orders and applicable fees are final, and you may not request that the User pay a higher fee than the Genomics Services Fee specified in the applicable Accepted Order.</p>

			<h4 id="instant-orders">Instant Orders</h4>

			<p>
				During the Onboarding Process or by updating your Services Profile, you may choose to allow Users to submit Orders which, upon submission by the User, will automatically be deemed an "Accepted Order" (such Orders, "Instant Orders").  Using the functionality of the Site, you will be able to limit the types of Genomics Services that Users will be able to choose from under an Instant Order.  You will also be able to restrict Users’ ability to customize the Service Specifications and Protocols.  By allowing Users to place Instant Orders, you acknowledge that, with respect to each Instant Order submitted by a User, (i) you have waived your ability to review the terms of or to reject such Instant Order, and (ii) you agree to perform the Genomics Services and deliver the Results in accordance with the terms of such Instant Order and these Terms of Use as described below.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if prior to commencing the Genomics Services described in an Instant Order we notify you that we have required the applicable User to satisfy one or more Payment Conditions, you agree to comply with our reasonable instructions with respect to such Instant Order, including but not limited to waiting to commence the Genomics Services until such User has satisfied the Payment Conditions.
			</p>

			<p>
				You acknowledge and agree that: (a) changes to your Services Profile may take up to [<strong><em>] [hours/days] to take effect on the Site; and (b) if you remove or alter any Genomics Services from your Services Profile, you will still be required to perform such services with respect to any outstanding Accepted Orders and any Instant Orders which Users submit during the [</em></strong>] [hour/day] period necessary for the change to your Services Profile to take effect on the Site.
			</p>

			<h4 id="payment-terms">Payment Terms</h4>

			<p>
				In consideration for providing an online platform connecting you with Users, for each Accepted Order submitted by an External User, you agree that we may retain all External User Fees we receive from such External User.  You further agree that nothing hereunder shall entitle you to any portion of the External User Fees.
			</p>

			<p>
				For each Accepted Order, whether submitted by an Internal User or an External User, we agree to transfer to you the Genomics Services Fees we actually receive from such User (such fees actually received, "Collected Fees") no later than thirty (30) days after we receive such Collected Fees from the User.  We will use commercially reasonable efforts to collect Genomics Services Fees from Users.  You acknowledge and agree that: (a) we cannot guarantee payment by Users; and (b) you are only entitled to receive and we are only obligated to transfer to you the Collected Fees and not any Genomics Services Fees we are unable to collect using commercially reasonable efforts.  To the extent we employ any third party collection service to collect past due amounts, you agree that only the portion collected and paid to us (less any collection service fees owed to or retained by the third party) will be transferred to you.
			</p>

			<p>
				In consideration for providing an online platform connecting you with Users, you agree to pay us a monthly service fee (the "Meenta Service Fee") equal to the product of (i) the total Collected Fees we received during the applicable calendar month from Users for whom you performed Genomics Services, multiplied by (ii) the applicable Service Fee Percentage (as defined below).  The "Service Fee Percentage" applicable in a given calendar month shall be calculated as follows:
			</p>

			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th style="text-align:left"></th>
						<th style="text-align:center"></th>
						<th>Service Fee Percentage</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align:left"></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<p>
				The sum of (A) your Internal User Credit, plus (B) Collected Fees we received from Users for whom you performed Genomics Services, was greater than or equal to $1,500,000 during the applicable calendar month       | Five Percent (5%)
				The sum of (A) your Internal User Credit, plus (B) Collected Fees we received from Users for whom you performed Genomics Services, was between $750,000 and $1,500,000 during the applicable calendar month      | Ten Percent (10%)      |
				The sum of (A) your Internal User Credit, plus (B) Collected Fees we received from Users for whom you performed Genomics Services, was less than $750,000 during the applicable calendar month | Fifteen Percent (15%)      |
			</p>

			<p>
				As used herein, "Internal User Credit" means the total Collected Fees we received during a calendar month from your Internal Users for Genomics Services performed by other Hosts.
			</p>

			<p>
				On or around the first day of each calendar month, we will invoice you for the Meenta Service Fee for the Collected Fees we received during the prior month.  You agree to pay us all such invoiced Meenta Service Fees within thirty (30) days after receipt of invoice.  All fees payable hereunder are exclusive of any applicable sales, use, and other taxes, and you agree to pay (or reimburse us, as the case may be) any taxes due in connection with this Agreement, other than taxes on our income.  All payments shall be made in U.S. Dollars.  In addition to any other remedies available to us hereunder, if you fail to pay any undisputed Meenta Service Fees within thirty (30) days after payment is due, then you shall pay us a late payment charge equal to 1.25% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if lower).
			</p>

			<h4 id="communication-tool-amendments-to-the-services">Communication Tool; Amendments to the Services</h4>

			<p>
				Once we have notified you of an Accepted Order, you (and your Registered Users) may correspond with the User using the Site’s messaging tool (the "Communication Tool").  You agree to use the Communication Tool with the User solely to inquire about or otherwise discuss the Materials (including the Protocols), the Results and/or your performance of the Genomics Services (including any related Sequencing Equipment and Service Specifications).  You acknowledge and agree that you may not use the Communication Tool to offer, or respond to the User’s requests for, additional services not described in the applicable Accepted Order or to engage in discussions other than in accordance with the preceding sentence.  You agree not to modify or amend, or purport to modify or amend, any of the terms in these Terms of Use in any communications with a User, including using the Communication Tool.  Meenta reserves the right to review any messages you send or receive via the Communication Tool, including without limitation to enforce the restrictions set forth in this paragraph.
			</p>

			<p>
				Using the "Amendments" feature of the Communication Tool, either you or the User may propose to the other party (the "Reviewing Party") an amendment to the Genomics Services or the terms you have agreed to provide a User, including but not limited to the Genomics Services Fees, Service Specifications or Protocols (a "Services Amendment").  Once a Services Amendment has been proposed, the Reviewing Party will receive a notification through the Site’s Communication Tool and will be able to review and either accept or reject the proposed Services Amendment.  If the Reviewing Party chooses to accept, then the Services Amendment (including any changes to the Service Specifications and/or the Protocols) will be deemed effective.  You acknowledge and agree that: (a) you shall not modify or amend the Genomics Services or the terms you have agreed to provide a User (other than through the "Amendments" feature of the Communication Tool as described in this paragraph); and (b) any such attempted modification or amendment shall be deemed to have no effect hereunder.
			</p>

			<h4 id="delivery-of-specimens-to-host">
				Delivery of Specimens to Host
			</h4>

			<p>
				Each User agrees to deliver all Specimens and any other biological, chemical or other materials and related documentation and information specified in the applicable Accepted Order (collectively, the "Materials") to you at the address listed in your Meenta Account according to the timeline specified in the applicable Accepted Order.  Meenta requires each User to agree that the Materials (including without limitation Specimens) delivered to you will not include, and each such User agrees not to share with you, any personally identifiable information, including without limitation any "Protected Health Information" or "PHI" (as defined in 45 C.F.R. 160.103).  In the event that PHI is inadvertently shared, you shall immediately notify the User and Meenta upon discovery and shall protect from unauthorized access, use and disclosure all such PHI as required of any "Business Associate" under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and implementing regulations ("HIPAA") and applicable state law.
			</p>

			<h4 id="handling-storage-and-disposal-of-specimens-results">
				Handling, Storage and Disposal of Specimens; Results
			</h4>

			<p>
				With respect to each Accepted Order, you agree to comply with the Protocols selected by the User for the applicable Accepted Order and any applicable laboratory, regulatory, and health and safety guidelines and regulations governing: (a) the handling, storage and use of Specimens, until such times as the Genomics Services have been completed; and (b) disposal of any excess Specimens upon completion of the Genomics Services.  You agree to cooperate with us if the User requests that the Materials be returned.  In the event of any such return of Materials, the User will be obligated to pay for shipping and will bear the risk of loss upon your delivery of such Materials to a common carrier.  If a User requests the return of Materials prior to your commencement of the Genomics Services, you agree that no Genomics Services Fees will be due for such cancelled Accepted Order. Upon completion of the Genomics Services, you must promptly: (i) upload the Results to the Site in accordance with any written instructions we provide; and (ii) notify us by e-mail or using the functionality of the Site that the Results are available to be viewed and downloaded at the URL you provide us.
			</p>

			<h4 id="host-representations-and-warranties">Host Representations and Warranties</h4>

			<p>You represent and warrant that the Genomics Services will be performed in accordance with the applicable Service Specifications (including the timelines set forth therein) by qualified personnel (the "Services Warranty").  Upon any breach of the Services Warranty, you agree to, in our sole discretion: (a) re-perform the non-conforming Genomics Services so that they conform to the Services Warranty at no additional charge; or (b) if we or the User determines in our sole discretion that you are unable to re-perform the non-conforming Genomics Services, (i) cooperate with us to arrange for an alternate Host to re-perform the Genomics Services, including by delivering all Materials and Results (if any) in your possession to the alternate Host at your own expense, and (ii) return to Meenta any Collected Fees we have paid you for the non-conforming Genomics Services.  You acknowledge and agree that if you breach the Services Warranty, you will not be entitled to receive any payment from Meenta in connection with the applicable Accepted Order.</p>
