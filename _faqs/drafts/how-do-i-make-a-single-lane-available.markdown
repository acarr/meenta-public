To make a lane available, you need to setup an instrument in your meenta lab. Then use the 'Create Scheduled Run' This will allow you to specific the date, number of available lanes and the configure; Paired End vs Single Read, Read Length etc.

Once the lane is scheduled it will appear on our search engine.
