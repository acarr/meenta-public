There are two ways to 'book' lanes on Meenta: Instant Book and Requests. Instant books provide a way to book lanes that are configured and ready. When a host needs to fill a flow cell, they can make lanes available for instant bookings. This means there is no back and forth process, as will happen when a user requests a specific configuration.

When a host opens a machine up for requests, these provide the user with the ability to request a number of lanes, configurations and dates. The host can then either approve or decline. Unlike an instant book, the user needs to wait for confirmation.

Rule of Thumb: if you need a sample sequenced ASAP, then look for instant bookings. If you have time, then you can make a request and communicate with a host.
