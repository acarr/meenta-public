If your sample arrives a the host and fails QC, the host has several
options.

#### For Booking Requests

Hosts may cancel the request and accept other samples for the same run. The Host
may rebook the failed samples on the next available run date assuming the new
samples pass incoming QC.

Users may cancel the request without penalties if the run date is greater than
4 days out.

Account suspension. If the User submits 5 or more booking requests with QC
failures within a 6 month period, we may deactivate their account.

#### For Instant Bookings

Hosts may cancel the request and accept other samples for the same run. The
Host may rebook the failed samples on the next available run date assuming
the new samples pass incoming QC.

Users may cancel the request without penalties if the run date is greater
than 2 days out.

Account suspension. If the User submits 2 or more instant bookings with sample
failures within a 6 month period, we may deactivate their account.
