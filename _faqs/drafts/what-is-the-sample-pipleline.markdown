The 'sample pipeline' is our term for how samples move through
through our system. Think of it as a pipeline that starts with your
need for sequencing, through search, purchase, shipping, receive,
QC, instrumentation, and data delivery.

We want user to have visibility into the entire pipeline. As your
sample moves we provide update via SMS, email or via our web app.
