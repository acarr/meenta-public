For Instant Bookings the Host must deliver your data within 5 business days.

For Booking Requests the Host must deliver your data within 10 business days.

Why the different delivery periods? Instant books are scheduled, so host
resources are dedicated. With Booking Requests the Hosts have a larger delivery
period to allows for short term instrument schedule changes.
