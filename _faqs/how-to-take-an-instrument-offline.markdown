There are two steps to taking a instrument offline; remove scheduled lanes and set the request status.

Step 1: Check the instruments scheduled runs. Remove any future lanes you might have already added.

Step 2: Update the instrument to disable the flag that lets users make a request.

You can confirm that the instrument is offline, by doing a search!
