Instant Booking: This provides a way to book lanes or flow cells that are pre-configured and are
ready to go on a specific date. This means there is no back and forth since both the User is committed
to having samples run a specific date...

Booking Requests: This provides the user with the ability to request, from the Host, the number of
lanes or flow cells, read length and read type for a future date. The host can then either approve
or decline. Unlike an instant book, the user needs to wait for confirmation.

Rule of Thumb: if you need a sample sequenced ASAP, then look for instant bookings. If you have time,
then you can make a request and communicate with a host.
