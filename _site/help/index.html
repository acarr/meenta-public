<li>
	<span class="question" style="padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px !important;">How does instant book differ from another booking?</span>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none !important;">
		<p>There are two ways to ‘book’ lanes on Meenta: Instant Book and Requests. Instant books provide a way to book lanes that are configured and ready. When a host needs to fill a flow cell, they can make lanes available for instant bookings. This means there is no back and forth process, as will happen when a user requests a specific configuration.</p>

<p>When a host opens a machine up for requests, these provide the user with the ability to request a number of lanes, configurations and dates. The host can then either approve or decline. Unlike an instant book, the user needs to wait for confirmation.</p>

<p>Rule of Thumb: if you need a sample sequenced ASAP, then look for instant bookings. If you have time, then you can make a request and communicate with a host.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="answer" style="display: none !important;">
		<p>The QC that the Host performs is already included in the pricing they display.  You may also opt out of QC and request that your sample be run “at risk”, however, the Host has the option to reject these types of samples.</p>

	</div>
</li>

<li>
	<span class="question" style="padding-bottom: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px !important;">I need my samples processed immediately. What should I do?</span>
	<div class="answer" style="display: none !important;">
