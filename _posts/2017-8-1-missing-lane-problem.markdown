The ‘Missing Lane Problem’ is an often understated problem in the Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) space. The cost of the equipment, cost of reagents used for each instrument run, and the number of configurations mean that NGS equipment have to be fully utilized before an instrument can start.

At Meenta, we focus on the ‘missing lane problem’ because it cuts through all the noise and illustrates an interesting challenge that often gets lost in the efforts of researchers, labs and universities.

Before diving into this problem, it’s worth noting that this problem is not specific to research or NGS. It has a different set of economic constraints and impacts, but the underlying impacts are the same; variations in demand and unused capacity impact price and delivery. The travel industry, airlines, trains and bus companies, all need to operate with as many passengers as possible.

Travelers know that airlines adjust their schedules and destinations to keep their planes full, and try to keep every seat full. Travelers, while unhappy when inconvenienced when schedules change, know that if their flight is undersold, it might be cancelled by the airline. When demand changes to much, entire airline routes might be cancelled.

Services like Priceline and Orbitz have built their business model around this exact problem; filling unsold minute seats with algorithms to adjust pricing in real time.

Running an Illumina NextSeq with 2 of its 8 lanes empty is more impractical for a core lab than it is is for an airline company. For science and research this problem is described as the ‘empty lane problem’, where the passengers are the samples or lanes on a sequencer. Unlike the travel industry, which can afford to build in some unsold seats on a flight, equipment owners are much more restricted in their options.

Equipment owners have a few technique for adjusting to unsold or missing lanes. In practice core labs solve the issue that come with mismatched samples and lanes by building a sample queue. They assume their instrument will have downtime when it can not run because it can not be run half full, so factor the cost of downtime in their per sample price. And when demand is too variable, the core lab simply do not buy more equipment.

While pricing and equipment utilization is important in the grand scheme, the impact of missing lanes impacts researchers and their project on a daily basis. When a researcher comes to a lab with samples they need to run on a given instrument, the core lab manager needs to fit their request into the core labs queue of samples, both on a first come/first serve basis, but also on a equipment and configuration basis. The question is often, do I have any samples in the queue that can be combined with what this researcher needs. If the answer is yes, then core lab and tell both the waiting sample owner and the new sample owner when the sample will run. If the answer is no, then the core lab put the sample in its queue, wait for a match, and tell both researchers to wait.

Every core lab is different, but wait times can vary from weeks to months.

The more variations of lanes and configurations in the queue, the harder it is to fill lanes and schedule the sample to run. The impact of this issue is that samples wait in equipment queues, researchers wait for data and equipments stands unused. Waiting drives up costs and slows down research. While research equipment was never purchased or priced with any assumption of 100% utilization, the impact of missing lanes impacts every lab and research facility.

There are no tools or techniques to help cut through these issues. The solution is to provide not a listing service for equipment, or a public scheduling service, but a platform that provides a live marketplace for core labs to fill unused lanes with sample.

The concept of providing live, lane-level access to sequencers, requires new approach to the pricing and operations of equipment. Researchers and funding providers can now factor the individual price of lane into their grant and experiment budgets.

For researchers, the experiment design and budgeting can focus on short term changes in their experiments, and a per lane price. Researchers can break experiments down, and process samples across multiple trusted core labs.

For Core Labs and large research institutions, the process of filling lanes to maximize instrument utilization becomes much easier, with queues and wait times decreasing. Cores can factor higher utilization numbers into their pricing.

This is the goal; changing the underlying assumptions and economics of experiment design and sequencing. While the economics of any issue is important, the value of any change must be seen in day to day operations; faster cheaper science.

If you own equipment are thinking about Meenta, ask yourself, how would my lab and the researchers I work with be impacted by the option of filling ‘missing lanes’. How often has this issue impacts a researches timeline for their research. Every lab is different, but the challenge supply and demand and finite resources is not.
