						<h4>How it works</h4>
						<p>As a Host you can make full flow cells or any number of lanes available for booking. Our search engine will match your facilities description along with the instrument run configuration to users on the site. An instant booking will require you to run the samples on the designated dates. Once the booking is complete communicate with the User via our Chat application. The samples will arrive in our pre-paid packaging to your facility.</p>
