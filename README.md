#### Local Jekyll Development
The following will allow a developer or design to run the
Jekyll engine locally. This will watch for changes and
update the site.

    `bundle exec  jekyll serve --watch`
	  or
	  `jekyll serve --watch`

Here is a reference document for getting Jekyll setup
to provide the content locally.

#### Setup Local Environment
