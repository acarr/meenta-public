						<h4>Late Fees</h4>
						<p>Timely delivery of samples by Users reduces the chances that any one late sample could potentially delay another User's run on the same instrument. Similarly, timely delivery of data by Hosts reduces the chance that any given User's projects' deadlines are missed.</p>

						<h4>Cancelation Policy</h4>
						<p>An order may be cancelled within the first 48 hours of booking without penalties. After the initial 48 hours, you can cancel up to 3 orders every 6 months. If you cancel more than 3 bookings your account may be de-activated.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="text-block">
						<h4>Late Data Delivery</h4>
						<p>A late Data Delivery fee of 10% is applied to the Host when they miss their Data Delivery date; 8-10 days from the Instrument Run Window.</p>

					<div class="text-block">
						<h4>Late Sample Arrival</h4>
						<p>If a sample arrives late, after the Sample Arrival Date or is submitted less than 2 business days prior to the Instant Booking date, the user will be charged a 10% fee. Why a fee? The Host will need to reschedule your sample and potentially delay another User's samples.</p>
