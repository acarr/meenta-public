						<h4>Penalties</h4>
						<p>Yes, Meenta has penalties.</p>
						<p><strong>Late Samples</strong> If a sample arrives late, after the ‘Delivery Date’, the user will be charged a 10% fee. Why a fee? The host will need to reschedule your sample in their LIM system.</p>
						<p><strong>Data Delivery</strong> If the host does not deliver sample data by the ‘Data Delivery’ date, then Meenta assesses the host a 10% fee.</p>
